# Agenda

This presentation aims to clarify the capability of Deep Learning, the context of its huge successes along with
limitations that are lesser known to the public.

# 1. What it can do right now?
Classical applications working on image or text.
* For example, very good image classification:

             alt="ImageNet Revolution of Depth" style="width: 500px;"/>]

* Solving emerging problems such as network effect (e.g. how a large crowd of people behave
in specific context such as social network)
---
# 2. How does it work at a high level?
* **Machine Learning**
    * ability of a machine to learn
    * using large data sets **instead of hard coded rules**.

* **Deep Learning**:
    * a subfield of machine learning
    * comprises of artificial neural networks.

---

# 3. Why it didn't happen earlier?

* Availability of huge data sets (e.g. ImageNet 14,197,122 images in 2010)

* Computing power of GPU that can process large amount of data

* Positive feedback loop of research that brings commercial values

    * Big companies pouring money into Deep Learning

    * Huge crowd of talents join the field that push the research boundary

# 4. What have not been solved by DL?

* "Explainable AI"

    - We have little explanation why the same model works for some cases and doesn't work in other cases.

# 5. What have not been solved by DL?

* Robust against adversarial attacks

    - For example, modification of some pixels cannot fool human eyes, but makes the algorithms fail.

# 5. What have not been solved by DL?

* Why vs what?

    - Success in closed question: What are there in the picture? What is the emotion (positive or negative)?

    - Not yet in open questions: Why people laugh?

# 5. What have not been solved by DL?

* Artificial general intelligence

    - Specialized efficiency at one task or similarly related tasks e.g. AlphaGo.

    - But not generically good as an ordinary kid who both can play decent games and can classify image.

# Summary
1. What it can do right now?
    - Improves many existing technologies & new applications
2. How does it work?
    - Under the hood, it is based on neural networks (layers of weights)
3. Why it didn't happen earlier?
    - big data
    - computing power
    - feedback loop of commercial values
4. What have not been solved by DL?
    - Explainable AI
    - Robustness against adversarial attacksa
    - "Deeper" understanding (e.g. not only _what_ but _why_ and _how_)
    - Artificial General Intelligence (not only specific but also generic)
