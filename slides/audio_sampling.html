# 1. Physics of Sound

* _Propagation_ of a _wave of pressure_ through a transmission medium (e.g. air)
    - Vibration has frequency
    - Human speech 100 Hzâ€“4 kHz range
* Loss: The wave weaken as they propagate: you have to shout to call someone afar.

* Need for reconstruction: For longer distance transmission, we need to digitize the sound and transmit as electrical signal (Telephone - 1870s).

# 2. Sampling of Audio Signal

* **Necessity**: Physical sound is continuous but we can only store digital signal in hardware.

* Sampling is the reduction of a continuous-time signal <span style="color:green">S(t)</span> to a discrete-time signal <span style="color:blue">Si</span>.

count: false
* Reconstruction is through interpolation. The more samples, the easier to construct the signal.
    - **Exploitation**: Don't need to record **all** the points in the middle.

* Accept that the reconstruction is an **approximation**.

# Under- & Oversampling

* Imagine the original signal is one sinusoidal. We sample at <span style="color:red">red</span> dots.

* Undersampling ~ _"not sufficient"_ (A, C < 2f)

* Oversampling ~ _"more than sufficient"_ (B >= 2f)

* All reconstruction are just _approximations_
    - but B still remains the main frequency of the signal.

# Under- & Oversampling

* Undersampling: Signal varies faster than the sampling process can capture.

* Oversampling: Sampling process capture more often than the signal varies.

# Analogy to the Mind

1. Our memory = hard disk storing digitized copies of the continuous sequence of events.

--
count:false
2. Our observation or awareness = sampling the environment and sampling the moment.

--
count:false
3. Remember during time of sharp changes e.g. most people remember exactly what they did during the September 11.
--
count:false
4. Most people don't remember what they eat for lunch 3 days ago.

--
count:false
5. Perception of time duration is more proportionate to the number of events.

_Disclaimer: My personal interpretation only, with no scientific neurological survey of how the brain works._

???
1. Our memory of the past can be considered as a digital copy of the continuous sequence of events.

2. Our observation/awareness is like probing the environment and sampling the moment to add into that collection of events.

3. We tend to remember the events that are _sudden, suprising_ as if they are high frequency. Probably we automatically increase the sampling rate (aware more) at the time of changes.

4. Most people don't remember what they eat for lunch 3 days ago because the lunches are not significantly different from day to day. So people can reduce the sampling rate about those.

5. Perception of time duration is more proportionate to the number of events taken in the time line rather than the absolute length of the timeline.

# Reframe the sampling principles to the Mind

1. Sample more in the time of frequent changes
    - A lot of changes in the 20s.
--
count:false
2. Be careful with the hypothesis formed by undersampling
    - All models are approximations.
    - But some models are completely wrong if undersampling.
    - Especially when making a decision: verify all related hypothesis.
--
count:false
3. Real time processing vs Processing from Database
    - Live in **present** vs in the **past**
    - We need to let the brain exercise _**real time processing**_ too.

# Summary

1. Physics of Sound
    - Propagate as wave in a transmission medium
    - Need to be converted to digital signal
--
count: false
2. Sampling in Audio Signal Processing
    - Sampling does the Analog-to-Digital conversion
    - If undersampling, reconstruct poor model
--
count: false
3. Analogy to the Mind
    - Sample more often in times of changes
    - Double check the assumption with undersampling before making decisions
    - Balance the exercise for _real time processor_
