Sometimes I question myself, why I learned German with so much enthusiasm? Speaking to others in the new language giving a new identity.

To be honest, I learned not only about the languages - the external, I also learned tremendously about myself - the internal mechanics of my mind.  The later significantly determine my engagement in many other areas of my life as well. I could easily translate my process of learning into other goals such as creation, or finance, or even relationship. 

At some points I realise that learning a language has moulded me as well. 

## 1. The same person facing the same decision with different explanation

Why is there an element of maturity here? It is because I observe how different my perspectives are before and after learning each language. Before, I would always have enough conviction to NOT do it. But after somehow I got myself into the learning process, my perspective switched instantly. For example, at school in Singapore, I had feared that taking Chinese course would degrade my over GPA (Grade Point Average) - which was as important as Oxygen to me. I have no idea why I registered for it (maybe sparked by interest from my semester in the US - where I met many Chinese at a speaking club). But I registered for the course and I had so much fun in the class - I am confident that this course can only help boosting my GPA. I enjoyed the ride so much! Up till I got a B for that course with total surprise - I had no explanation for that score because I everything I did was with the best I could think of. I am among the most active in the class. But after a week of disappointment  over the score, I waked up and looked at it differently. It taught me a lesson: I could still enjoyed the whole ride even though the score doesn't meet my expectation. An old lesson disguises in the new situation: it is the journey rather than destination. 

I still had the right to expect - but the result no matter how sure I was then, could turn out to be different from what I expect. Even the reaction I had right then, would be something I never expected as well. It taught me humility against the strong hope. 

## 2. How many resources show up as I look for them

Then I moved to France. I had great admiration for those foreigner friends who can speak French (and of course English). But it turn out that I didn't have time to learn the language itself (I had so many homework projects then). But I paid the time back after I graduated and left the country, moved the new job in Germany. I learned French as a continuation of what I had earlier. There I listened and learn so many vocabularies. Entirely by myself I could later understand the new report. 

Learning German is so far the largest investment. And I also changed my perspective the largest. I even change my strategy over the time. It first to hack the certification exam quickly - I learn enough to pass the exam. The certificate doesn't satisfy me enough - I registered for the B2 exam in the end of the year. I felt like I was almost in a race for certificate. It is how I have long functioned earlier - being exam-driven. But it turns out that I need more to fully appreciate the level. 

I have been living in the same city for the past two years but only in the last more than half a year - I realised the resources that are so abundance. The Volkshochschule. 

But it also introduces some brakes to adjust my expectation (some course are difficult, or different expectation) - they aren't the best courses in the world. But for the prices, for the teach, for the experience, for the sense of affiliation to a system, I find the prices reasonable. 

My perspective before was quite extreme: something is good other thing are bad. But gradually I realise the both sides of the matter and I shift my focus on that. 

## 3. I see the good side of the comparison 

Learning German I made so many relation to English at one point you would find that grammar in German is unnecessarily complicated - as I see it. Then you see that the pronunciation is way more easier than English. 1-1 even. In any comparison, one would win the other. The positive or optimistic person would only see the bright sides. 

## 4. I appreciate how small improvement promises a surprising reward later

When I learn a new vocabulary - I never know exactly how it will come back later to me. But I am confident that at some day in the future it will help me. It aligns well with my saving habit. 

Learning a language has a balanced mixture ("mischung") of delayed gratification and guaranteed reward. 

## 5. It teaches me a lesson that adversity is a boost for motivation

As I grew up in the village, I didn't have many resources for learning. But then when the resources are abundant. I still treasure it and get the best out of them.
