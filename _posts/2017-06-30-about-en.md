Hello World! I am Hưng Tư. Welcome to my little studio!

I am from Vietnam. Currently, I am living in Berlin, working with Machine Learning problems. I also contributed to the open source to [RiveScript](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-python){:target="_blank"}, a simple scripting language for chatbots. 

Before moving to Germany, I had an opportunity to study and live in several countries. I graduated from a Master degree in Applied Mathematics in Machine Learning and Computer Vision [MVA](http://cmla.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-anglaise/academics/mva-master-degree-227777.kjsp?RH=DL_CMLA-GB) from [Department of Mathematics](http://www.ens-cachan.fr/en/school/departments/mathematics-department){:target="_blank"}, [École normale supérieure de Cachan](http://ens-cachan.fr/){:target="_blank"} in France (now renamed to [École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay](http://ens-paris-saclay.fr/)), with intensive training on mathematical modeling and machine learning. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering from [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx){:target="_blank"}, Singapore. During my undergraduate, I also spent a semester as an exchange student to [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}, USA.

Besides my work, I enjoy learning foreign languages. I translated and reviewed Vietnamese subtitles for some [TED Talks and Lessons](https://www.ted.com/profiles/1815860/translator){:target="_blank"} in English, translated some Quora answers from English or German to Vietnamese, set up a multilingual entry in Wikipedia about my [high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Quy_Don_High_School_for_the_Gifted,_Danang){:target="_blank"} in Vietnam. 

Happy reading!

PS: My "studio" is honored to have visitors from many corners of the world. Thanks all for dropping by!
