As I want to reduce my time spent on YouTube, I find it is hard to do so. In my opinion, it is because YouTube offers many insightful videos on various personal topics. That makes YouTube irresistible, even though many other videos are just utterly mindless. So I decide to try out this experiment of listing out only those videos that I would like to revisit again and again, to immerge myself on those topics that I am interested in. 

1. A kinder, gentler philosophy of success, Alain de Botton
